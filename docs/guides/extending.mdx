# Extending Civet

## DataProvider

The main place for bringing your own functionality to Civet is the [`DataProvider`](../api/core#dataprovider).
You can simply add your own functionality to it by extending the class and then accessing it from within a [`Resource`](../api/core#resource) or from somewhere else.

However, this might not be sufficient in all cases, for example if your custom functionality requires the use of React hooks or if you want to extend the [`ResourceContext`](../api/core#resourcecontext).

If this is the case, you can use [`DataProvider`](../api/core#dataprovider)'s `extend` method.
This method is called when initialising the [`DataProvider`](../api/core#dataprovider) and provides an API for registering various plugins.

:::warning
Please note that the `extend` method is called by the [`DataProvider`](../api/core#dataprovider)'s constructor, so probably before your own constructor's logic is executed.
:::

There are currently two types of plugins which can be registered using the `extend` function, [context plugins](#context-plugins) and [UI plugins](#ui-plugins).
They are both used to extend the [`ResourceContext`](../api/core#resourcecontext) but differ in where they can be used and what you can accomplish with them.

```js
class MyDataProvider extends DataProvider {
  extend(extend) {
    super.extend(extend);

    // Register a context plugin
    extend.context(useMyContextPlugin);

    // Register a UI plugin
    extend.ui(MyUIPlugin);
  }

  // ...
}
```

### Context plugins

Context plugins are React hooks for extending the [`ResourceContext`](../api/core#resourcecontext).
They work for both the [`Resource`](../api/core#resource) component and the [`useResource`](../api/core#useresource) hook.

As these plugins are handled as React hooks, they may use React hooks (for example `useMemo`) themselves.
Context plugins cannot render any content.

Context plugins are handled in the order they are registered, always before [UI plugins](#ui-plugins).

Their signature is:

```js
/**
 * @param {object} context - the ResourceContext to be modified
 * @param {props} context - custom props passed to useResource or Resource
 * @returns the modified memoized ResourceContext
 **/
function useMyContextPlugin(context, props) {
  return context;
}
```

:::warning
The context returned by a context plugin must be memoized, for example by using React's `useMemo` hook.
:::

### UI plugins

UI plugins are React components for extending the [`ResourceContext`](../api/core#resourcecontext).
They only work for the [`Resource`](../api/core#resource) component and are ignored for the [`useResource`](../api/core#useresource) hook.
However, when using the [`useResource`](../api/core#useresource) hook, UI plugin functionality can be enabled by using the [`ResourceProvider`](../api/core#resourceprovider) component.

You can use UI plugins to render additional content.

UI plugins are handled in the order they are registered, always after [context plugins](#context-plugins).

Their signature is:

```js
function MyUIPlugin({ ...props, context, children }) {
  // UI plugins must always render the result of the children function.
  // The children function takes the (un)modified context as its only argument.
  return children(context);
}

MyUIPlugin.propTypes = {
  props: PropTypes.object, // custom props passed to Resource
  context: PropTypes.object, // the ResourceContext to be modified
  children: PropTypes.func, // render props function to pass the modified memoized context down
}
```

:::warning
The context passed down by a UI plugin must be memoized, for example by using React's `useMemo` hook.
:::

## DataProvider plugins

You can bundle related functionality in standalone plugin functions in order to make them reusable by others.

The [`createPlugin`](../api/core#createplugin) function creates a plugin that can simply be called on an existing [`DataProvider`](../api/core#dataprovider) implementation.
You can then extend it like described above in the [DataProvider section](#dataprovider).
